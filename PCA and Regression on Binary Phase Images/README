Exercise 01 — PCA and Regression on Binary Phase Images

Overview
This project explores dimensionality reduction and regression modeling on a dataset of binary microstructure images. The goal is to predict the white-phase area fraction of each image using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and regression models (linear and polynomial).

Objectives
- Compute the area fraction of the white phase in each image.
- Apply PCA to reduce the 4096-dimensional image space.
- Reconstruct images and analyze reconstruction MSE vs number of components.
- Train linear and polynomial regression models to predict area fractions from PCA features.
- Evaluate model performance with Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Dataset
- 500 grayscale binary-phase images (64 × 64 px).
- Each image flattened into a 4096-element vector.
- Target → white-phase area fraction.

Implementation Workflow
1. Preprocessing – Load images → normalize → compute area fractions → CSV export.
2. PCA Reduction – Extract principal components using sklearn.decomposition.PCA.
3. Reconstruction Loss Analysis – Plot MSE vs number of components to find tolerance threshold.
4. Regression Modeling – Train linear and polynomial regressors on PCA features.
5. Evaluation – Compute and plot prediction MSE vs components and polynomial order.

Results Summary
- Optimal PCA components: ≈ 10–20 (retaining most variance with low MSE).
- Moderate polynomial degree improved fit without overfitting.
- Linear regression showed stable performance with low variance.
- Provided quantitative understanding of feature compression vs accuracy.

Key Learnings
- PCA effectively captures dominant morphological patterns in microstructures.
- Regression models link latent features to physical properties (area fraction).
- Built foundational skills in data preprocessing, feature reduction, and model evaluation.
